# EWAS
Apply covariate-adaptive FDR control methods into epigenome-wide association studies

This study involves five covariate-adaptive FDR control methods (IHW、CAMT、FDRreg、AdaPT、BL）in adjusting p values of epigenome-wide association studies, together with fourteen covariates.

There are folders "Code" and "Data", where you can find the data and source code to reproduce the results of aticle "Leveraging biological and statistical covariates improves the detection power in epigenome-wide association testing". And several rmarkdown files are provided as well as the html documents they produced.

1. Overview of the data sets
2. Evaluation of covariates
3. Performance on simulated EWAS data
4. Performance on real EWAS-data
5. Further validation of the recovered signals
6. P-value as a covariate
