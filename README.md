# EWAS

This study involves five covariate-adaptive FDR control methods (IHW、CAMT、FDRreg、AdaPT、BL）in adjusting p values of epigenome-wide association studies, together with fourteen covariates.

There are folders "Code" and "Data", where you can find the data and source code respectively, to reproduce the results of aticle "Leveraging biological and statistical covariates improves the detection power in epigenome-wide association testing". And several rmarkdown files are provided as well as the html documents they produced.
